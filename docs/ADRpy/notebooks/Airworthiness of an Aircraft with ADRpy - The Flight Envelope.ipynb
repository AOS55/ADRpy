    "*These uncertainties are typically handled by drawing up a conservative **flight envelope** that establishes the range of equivalent airspeeds and inertial loads that the aircraft is to be designed for. The algorithm for drawing up the flight envelope is typically set out by the certification document that defines the initial airworthiness requirements of the aircraft to be designed. In this notebook we base our discussion of the flight envelope (and how to draw it up in ADRpy) on the algorithm included in EASA's CS-23.*"
